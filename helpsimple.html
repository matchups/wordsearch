Enter a pattern in the "Basic Pattern" field and press Submit.  You can 
use "standard" wildcards, * or ?.  For example, F* to find all words 
starting with F or ??F* to find all words with the third letter F.  You can specify groups of letters with brackets;
for example, [AHIMOTUVWX] for letters with mirror symmetry or [a-m] for letters in the first half of the alphabet.  The special character
@ can be used for any consonant, # for any vowel, or & for any standard Roman numeral.
<P>
If you check the "any order" box, it will find words with the letters 
in any order.  For example, BE* will find any words containing both B and E.  Only one set of brackets can be used when this box is checked.  You can also use the "Repeat letters checkbox" to allow the specified letters to be repeated one or more times.  For example, EHORS with both boxes checked would give results including HEROES, HORSE, HORSES, HORSESHOE, and SHORE.
<P>
You can filter the final list of results with the minimum and maximum 
length boxes.
<P>
The main page should be stable and functional.  There are links to go to 
the previous version and the development version.
